# CLAUDE.md

This project is a platform for fishing and hunting guides to manage their businesses.
We'll be building it from my freelance kit repo (<https://github.com/uncommon-carp/kit>).
The kit has been cloned but otherwise untouched.

We'll be planning the implementation of this platform today. **We do not need to write code yet.**

We're not concerned with timeboxing or durations yet, just laying out our roadmap, requirements,
and documentation before getting started. This is intended to be a real product, not just a
portfolio piece.

There is a deeper breakdown of the platform and it's philosophies in GUIDE_PLATFORM_SPEC.md,
and that will be our jumping off point.
